    "The project aims to take data relating to immigration, and perform ETL such that the data can be further analysed. The process will use airflow, and spark to co-ordinate the retrieval of the data, and transformation into fact and dimension tables. These will be stored in amazon redshift, such that a backend web service could then access, and subsequently serve insights into the dataset on request.\n",

    "For decades, U.S. immigration officers issued the I-94 Form (Arrival/Departure Record) to foreign visitors (e.g., business visitors, tourists and foreign students) who lawfully entered the United States. The I-94 was a small white paper form that a foreign visitor received from cabin crews on arrival flights and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of entry into the United States. It listed the traveler's immigration category, port of entry, data of entry into the United States, status expiration date and had a unique 11-digit identifying number assigned to it. Its purpose was to record the traveler's lawful admission to the United States.\n",
